# Simplified Xray Core Management

This repository provides a set of scripts to simplify the installation and management of the Xray core, allowing you to run a personal VPN without needing a control panel. The main advantages of this approach are minimal resource usage and no requirement for a domain name or TLS certificates.

## Scripts Overview

- **`xray-install`**: Automates the entire setup process. It installs the Xray core, configures it with a primary user, and creates a single management script (`xray-manager`) for all user-related tasks.
- **`xray-uninstall`**: Completely removes the Xray core and all associated configuration files and scripts from your server.

## Installation

To install Xray, run the following command. The script will prompt you to enter a domain (optional) and a label for your first user.

```sh
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Petryanin/simple-xray-core/main/xray-install | bash
```

## User Management

After installation, a single command, `xray-manager`, is available for all user management tasks. Hereâ€™s how to use it:

**List all users:**

```sh
xray-manager list
```

**Add a new user:**

```sh
xray-manager add
```

**Remove a user:**

```sh
xray-manager remove
```

**Get the connection link for a specific user:**

```sh
xray-manager link
```

**Get the link for the first (main) user:**

```sh
xray-manager mainlink
```

A help file with these commands will also be created at `~/xray-help`.

## Uninstallation

To completely remove Xray and all related files, use this command:

```sh
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Petryanin/simple-xray-core/main/xray-uninstall | bash
```
